# Helicon Hell Project 2

## Part One: Admin interface

You have been tasked with creating a simple API to handle and analyze sensor data from various locations. The client is well-informed and has requested that we start with an MVP so that they can commence testing and receive feedback from other departments early. Youâ€™ve identified Django as the best tool for the job as the platform aligns nicely with the requirements.
